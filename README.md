# Keyboard-Monitoring-System
Keyboard monitoring system built in python that logs keystrokes and sends captured data via email. This project demonstrates keylogging functionality, secure data handling, and automated email alerts. Ideal for educational purposes or system monitoring tasks, with customizable email settings and logging intervals.
Software Keyloggers is a software program that can be installed onto a computer, which monitors all the user activities on the computer. When Keyloggers is installed in a computer, it is not shown either in start-up icons or anywhere else on the computer that is being monitored.
A keylogger system is a tool that records every keystroke made on a computer or device. The problem with traditional keyloggers is that they require physical access to the device in order to be installed, and can often be detected and removed by antivirus software. The goal of a keylogger system is to provide a solution that can be remotely installed, is undetectable by antivirus software, and can accurately record all keystrokes made on a device.
This information can then be retrieved and analyzed by authorized users, such as employers monitoring the activity of their employees, or parents monitoring their children's online activity. The keylogger system should be easy to install and use, while also being secure and tamper-proof to prevent unauthorized access to the recorded data.
